## **Information about the Dataset**

- This Dataset is about "Air Quality" monitoring. It contains information collected over one year (March 2004 to April 2005) by sensors installed in a polluted urban area in **_Italy_**. The sensors measured different air pollutants, weather conditions, and humidity levels.

- The Dataset records the concentrations of various air pollutants, such as carbon monoxide (CO), benzene (C6H6), and nitrogen oxides (NOx and NO2), along with weather data like temperature (T), relative humidity (RH), and absolute humidity (AH).

- Sensors embedded in a special air quality monitoring device were used to take hourly readings. These sensors were located at road level in a polluted area, making them suitable for urban air quality analysis.

- The data comes from a year-long monitoring period, making it one of the longest Datasets of its kind. It includes both the actual pollutant levels (measured by a certified analyzer) and the sensor responses. This allows researchers to study the sensors' accuracy and behavior over time.

- The sensors experienced "cross-sensitivities" (reacting to multiple pollutants, not just the one they're meant to detect) and "sensor drifts" (changes in sensor behavior over time). This can make the data less reliable unless properly analyzed.

- Missing values in the Dataset are marked as -200.

## **Expectations :**

The project aims to find:

1.How pollutants are distributed:
Understanding the common levels of pollutants like CO and benzene, and whether these levels are low, high, or vary.

2.Seasonal and monthly changes in pollution:
Identifying how pollution levels change across seasons, like higher emissions in winter due to heating or traffic-related changes.

3.Connections between pollutants:
Exploring how pollutants like CO and NOx are related, especially if they come from the same sources, such as vehicle emissions.

4.How pollutants relate to weather conditions:
Finding out how temperature, relative humidity, and absolute humidity affect pollutant levels. For example, warmer temperatures might increase ozone levels.

5.Consistency and outliers:
Finding pollutants that have steady levels versus those that vary a lot. Also spotting unusual spikes or drops in pollution.

6.Where pollutants commonly occur together:
Looking at typical combinations of pollutants, such as when CO and NOx are both high or low, and spotting any unusual or extreme situations.

7.Monthly trends for pollutants and temperature:
Observing changes in pollutant levels month by month, and tracking how temperature behaves during summer or other times of the year.

8.Impact of temperature and humidity on specific pollutants:
Understanding how combinations of temperature and humidity influence pollutant levels, like whether higher humidity reduces certain pollutants.

9.How temperature affects ozone across seasons:
Exploring how ozone levels vary with temperature, especially during sunny summer months when ozone is usually higher.
